The project aims to develop a mouse using the ATmega32U4 microcontroller integrated into the Arduino Leonardo board, along with a joystick. The main goal is to design a functional mouse without relying on conventional Arduino libraries. This unique approach provides an opportunity to deepen understanding of component communication while allowing for more advanced customization of mouse behavior. By foregoing standard libraries, the project highlights the fundamental principles of input device control, offering a rewarding hands-on experience in embedded electronics. This concise introduction outlines the motivations for choosing this methodology and establishes the groundwork for a thorough exploration throughout the report.
